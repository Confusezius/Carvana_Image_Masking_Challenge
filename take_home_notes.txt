1. Ensure that validation set contains no data that has relations to training set

2. Ensemble works best; border weights are useful too.

3. Train network on inverted image can prove useful as well

4. Train rough network on downsampled images, then train a better network on border crop images.

5. Postprocessing: find antenna splits and connect them
